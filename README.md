==============

A simple Django app to list OSS projects that need better support (whether funding or contributors). The purpose of this site is to provide a public list of what isn't currently well-supported in OSS, all in one place. What you do with this information is up to you (but I have some ideas...).

This site was originally based on a Google doc spreadsheet made by [@nayafia](http://twitter.com/nayafia), which [@jayfk](https://github.com/jayfk) kindly turned into a more manageable app.

Contributions
=============================

Please take a look at [how to contribute](https://github.com/jayfk/fundingoss.com/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).


Data
=========

The site has an endpoint that dumps all submitted projects as [json](http://fundingoss.com/json.json).
