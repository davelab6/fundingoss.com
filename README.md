fundingoss.com
==============

A simple Django app to list OSS projects that need better support (whether funding or contributors). The purpose of this site is to provide a public list of what isn't currently well-supported in OSS, all in one place. What you do with this information is up to you (but I have some ideas...).

This site was originally based on a Google doc spreadsheet, which [@jayfk](https://github.com/jayfk) kindly turned into a more manageable app. The original spreadsheet is locked for editing and is no longer active; please use this app instead to add additional projects.

Currently there is no function to modify projects once they have been added, but for now you can open an issue on this project or tweet [@nayafia](http://twitter.com/nayafia) and Nadia will take care of it.
